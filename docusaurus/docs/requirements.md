## Requirements

The driving force behind the Kisei engine is to provide rapid, iterative rulesets that can be applied actively and retroactively to any number of processes. It should also provide the ability to output the results of queries to the system that can then be interpreted by a graphical display, to allow for easy dissemination of that information.

It should also be scalable, with the ability to apply rules to up to 200,000 people when requested, and allow for the query of those people against the ruleset
